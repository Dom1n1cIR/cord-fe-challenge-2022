# cord Coding Challenge (Front-end)

### Introduction

Welcome! This coding challenge is designed to explore your React & SCSS Front-end skills. You will have to create a simple SPA based on the provided mockup and make a few API calls to a public web API.

### The challenge

You have to complete the test and write any necessary code so that the discover page looks like this [mockup] designs. All the images/icons you need are already imported and you can find them under the `images` folder.

The discover page should enable the user to search for movies as keywords are typed into the search bar. Functionality for filtering does not need to be implemented, however the filter categories should still be expandable/collapsable upon clicking. On mobile devices, the navigation bar should slide in from left to right when the user clicks on the hamburger icon, and back when the user clicks on a close icon or outside the `SideBar`. In addition, you have to add all the responsive stylesheets for the app to run smoothly on mobile devices.

PS. Once you've completed the test follow all the `TODO` comments to make sure you have implemented all required functionality.

Movie data can be queried via [theMovieDB]:

- Popular movies API doc: [popularMovies]
- Movie Genres API doc: [movieGenres]
- Search movies API doc: [searchMovies]

Packages & Technologies used in the repo:

- `axios`
- `sass`
- `react-router-dom`
